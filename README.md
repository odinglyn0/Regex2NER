# Regex2NER

# A lightweight Python tool for extracting and validating various data types from text using regex patterns.
## But can't NER models do this better?
### It's a trade-off. NER models excel at accuracy but are slow (milliseconds to seconds per operation), while this tool prioritizes speed over precision - operating in microseconds with accuracy that's sufficient for most use cases. Choose NER for complex entity recognition where context matters, choose RegexExtract for high-throughput scenarios where speed is critical and simple pattern matching suffices.
